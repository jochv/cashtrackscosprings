<div> <p>As a qualified tax accountant, we will work closely with you throughout the entire process, providing advice on best practices for minimizing liability while maximizing potential returns and savings opportunities.  New clients need to provide at least 3 years of prior returns, that include a depreciation schedule.  Tax planning is a critical part of any financial plan as it can potentially reduce liability and maximize tax benefits.  We can help you relieve that huge psychological burden, so you feel lighter and free from all that stress.  That’s why we offer strategies for the preparation and optimization of deductions/credits to reduce liabilities effectively.  Of the services we reviewed, there were limited options under $100 and those would only work for basic taxes with no state filing.  <br><br>  Checklists can help taxpayers identify potential issues before submitting their return, as well as ensuring all necessary information is included for accurate filing.  A Tax Resolution team member will review your submission and call you back shortly.  Tax laws are complex and ever-changing, making it difficult for you to stay up to date on the latest regulations and filing requirements.  Plus, it’s taxing on your peace of mind to have this kind of burden weighing you down.
